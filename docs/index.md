title: Simple notes, complex ideas.

Hi! Welcome to my **Digital Garden**.

My name is **Florencia Luz Duarte**. I'm a **Software Developer and Product Designer** from Argentina, currently working as Chief Product Officer (CPO) at [MiMIAT Health](https://mimiathealth.com).

This garden is the home of my ideas, projects and learnings.

It serves both as a **space to deepen my understanding of the concepts and ideas I engage with in Tech** and as **a platform to learn in public and share knowledge with the community**.

Enjoy and feel free to share any helpful links with others! âœ¨

**These notes are constantly evolving** so keep in mind that some of them could have errors or blank spaces in them. You will see a small callout in the text if something is missing or potentially incorrect.

**My brain is a bilingual mess, so half my notes are in English and the other half in Spanish**. To help you navigate them, each note's title is in the original language in which I wrote it. I'll try to provide translations whenever possible, but let me be honest from the start, some of themâ€”if not the majorityâ€”will remain forever in the original language in which they were written.
