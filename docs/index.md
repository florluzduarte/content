title: Simple notes, complex ideas.

Hi! Welcome to my **Digital Garden**.

My name is **Florencia Luz Duarte**. I'm a **Software Developer and Product Designer** from Argentina, currently working as Chief Product Officer (CPO) at [MiMIAT Health](https://mimiathealth.com).

This garden is the home of my ideas, projects and learnings.

It serves me both as a **place for fostering a deeper understanding of the concepts and thoughts that surround me** working in Tech, and as **a place to learn in public and share that knowledge with the community**.

Enjoy and share with others any link that might be of help âœ¨

**This notes are constantly evolving** so keep in mind that some of them could have errors or blank spaces in them. You will see a small call out in the text if something is missing or potentially mistaken.

**My brain is a bilingual mess, so half my notes are in English and the other half in Spanish**. To help you navigate them, each note's title is in the original language I wrote it in. I'll try to provide translations every time that I'm able, but let me be honest from the start, some of them--if not the majority--will remain forever in the original language they were written.
