## Introduction 

**A Digital Garden is a place for thinking**. It's a space for connecting the dots between your thoughts about a topic and the information you gather about it. **It's the perfect tool for nerds who love to hoard data and are proud of being the know it all about certain domains**.  

Tending to a digital garden is like building a library based of your own notes about the topics you're obsessed with. **It's investing in having a system in place to store, prune and grow your thoughts and projects**.

It fosters a different way of thinking based on the connections and reflections you stablish between your notes.  

> "**The Garden is the web as topology**. The web as space. Itâ€™s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another. (...) **The Garden is building out a network of often conflicting information into a web that can generate insights, iterating it, allowing that to grow into something bigger than a single event, a single narrative, or single meaning.**"
