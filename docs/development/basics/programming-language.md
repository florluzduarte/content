## Definition  

> A programming language is a system of notations for writing computer programs. Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language (a group of symbols, letters and words taken from the alphabet that hold a particular meaning (different than the original) and have well defined rules for their implementation).

Programming languages allow us to interact with the computer. They are design to provide programmers a simpler way of creating instructions for machines to execute.   

All programming languages share a **set of basic instructions**: 

- **Input/Output Instructions**: For transferring data in and out of the computer.  
- **Calculus instructions**: To perform mathematical operations.  
- **Control Flow Instruction**: To modify the sequence of execution in a program.

## Types of programming languages  

### Machine language  

Machine language or [machine code](https://tokyotechlab.com/blogs/ngon-ngu-may), is a system of instructions represented by binary sequences (0s and 1s) used to communicate directly with the CPU.  

Machine language is the native language of computers. It's the only language they understand directly and use to execute operations.
