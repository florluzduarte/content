## Introduction    

>"When we now take the position that it is not only the programmer's task to produce a correct program but also to demonstrate its correctness in a convincing activity: the object he has to produce must be usefully structured."   

> "The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible."    

> "Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!"
